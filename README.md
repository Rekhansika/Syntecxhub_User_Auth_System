# Syntecxhub_User_Auth_System

## 📌 Project Description

The User Authentication System is a secure backend API built using Node.js and Express that enables users to register, log in, and access protected routes using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

The system ensures security by hashing user passwords using bcrypt before storing them in MongoDB. Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and sent to the user. This token must be included in the request headers to access protected routes.

The project demonstrates implementation of authentication, authorization, password encryption, token validation, error handling, and secure API design practices.

This project is suitable for learning backend authentication concepts and can be integrated into full-stack applications.
